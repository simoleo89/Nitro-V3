/**
 * Pure aggregation logic of the bulk path — modelled after the
 * `runBulk` reducer inside `useHousekeepingActions.ts`. The hook
 * itself is hard to drive cleanly in jsdom because it pulls
 * `useBetween`, `useNotification`, and the renderer-SDK mock through
 * a long transitive import chain. The actual aggregation is the
 * interesting bit and isolating it keeps the test fast + readable.
 *
 * Mirror of the production logic — if the hook's reducer changes,
 * this test should change with it.
